Delivery robot company, Hi this is a long shot but I have a delivery robot start up called Hive A&R, we have an innovative working prototype and an 80% functional app, I could have gone to investors and gotten a good chunk of change but I decided to make an NFT to raise the funds, its releasing in 10 stages the price and the attribute rarity increase with each wave. there is a 1 min videos detailing the robot and nfts at hivebots.xyz/about we also plan on releasing a Pokemon Go like game called HiveBots Roam where the player builds, hacks and battles to steal robots which exist as breedable NFTs on the block chain. The mint is technically live but I have no idea how to market it, and it this point my neck is on the wire so forgive me for reaching out so persistently please get in touch if you want to help
